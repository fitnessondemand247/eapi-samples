# eapi-samples
This repository contains samples of FitnessOnDemand EAPI implementation on Web, iOS, and Android. Please refer to our documentation (delivered directly) for a more in-depth set of instructions for incorporating our products.

Please be aware that these sample apps are primarily intended to guide the implementation of a Google Analytics layer on top of EAPI and Brightcove implementations. Each sample includes the requirements we have for analytics. While each sample also includes a functioning brightcove player implementation, only the web sample includes adoption of our EAPI endpoints to retrieve the necessary video metadata.
